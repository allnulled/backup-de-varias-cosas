Rem / La# / Rem / Lam

Rem
nothing to show
La#
nothing to hide
Rem
nothing's what i have
Lam
and now you know it

nothing to prepare
nothing to work on
nothing is my treasure
and i keep it nowhere

no matter who you are
no matter what you think
cause the answer's always
nothing nothing nothing

i go here and there
i do stupid things
my time is a waste
cause i am nothing

nothing is my worth
nothing is my name
nothing is the life
god made me live in

i could explain more
about this whole thing
but nothigness is
so deeply silent
